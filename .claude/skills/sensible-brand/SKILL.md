# Sensible Brand Skill

Guidelines for Wassem Moarsi's two brands. Apply these whenever producing copy, visual design, or technical recommendations for either brand.

## The two brands

**Sensible Bakery** — the business.
**wassembakes** — Wassem's personal creator brand (social, content, teaching).

Keep them distinct but visually and tonally adjacent. The business carries the legal and compliance weight; the creator brand carries personality and reach.

## Business details (Sensible Bakery)

- Legal/operating entity: **Dalissa Baking Co**
- Address: **30-30 47th Ave, Long Island City, NY**
- **FDA registered**
- **FSMA compliant** (Food Safety Modernization Act)
- **100% gluten-free, peanut-free, wheat-free, sesame-free kitchen** — no shared equipment, no cross-contact risk
- **Wassem Moarsi, CEO** — founder and head baker

Use these facts verbatim when accuracy matters (labels, wholesale decks, compliance-sensitive pages, retailer onboarding). Don't paraphrase regulatory or allergen claims.

## Wassem's background

Use this to anchor the "authoritative, real-science" voice — reference when a post benefits from credibility context, but don't shoehorn it in.

- **BS in Biology** and **MS in Biology**
- **20+ years** of professional baking
- Owner and operator of Sensible Bakery — the largest gluten-free and vegan bakery in NYC
- Grounds the creator brand's pitch: when Wassem talks ratios, extraction, gluten development, fermentation, the blood-sugar impact of ingredient choices — it's informed by actual biochemistry, not internet folklore

Good use: "I studied biology — here's what's actually happening to the starches when you let the dough rest."
Bad use: "Wassem Moarsi, a trained biologist, brings scientific expertise to baking." (that's marketing-speak)

## Bakery mission & values

Use as source material when writing About-page content, brand decks, or wholesale pitches. Paraphrase lightly — these are first-person values, not boilerplate.

- **Mission statement (use verbatim when needed):** "Food should nourish the body, respect animals, and protect the planet."
- **Product philosophy:** real, nutrient-dense ingredients. Pair protein + fiber in nearly every product to blunt glucose spikes. Moderate sugar. Healthy organic fats. Antioxidants where they fit naturally.
- **Sustainability:** composts on-site; avoids harsh chemicals and unnecessary preservatives; a portion of proceeds supports animal rescue, hunger relief, and environmental restoration.
- **Education posture:** mentors interns, shares baking science openly (blog, social, in-kitchen). Not gatekeeping.

When pitching Sensible on the creator brand (wassembakes), these values justify the shop link — it's not just commerce, it's the same philosophy Wassem talks about in his content.

## Sensible Bakery — content & campaign rules (HARD RULES)

These are non-negotiable for any Sensible Bakery social post, ad, carousel, GIF, or campaign creative. wassembakes (the creator brand) may cross-post/repost Sensible creative as-is — but do **not** write "with wassembakes" or co-brand on the slide; Sensible creative stands alone.

- **Never sell the product. Sell the lifestyle and the environment.** No "buy now," "grab a box," "order today," "shop," price, or product-pitch language on Sensible creative. Lead with values, feeling, and the way of eating/living — the product is the quiet proof, not the pitch. A soft `sensiblebakery.com` at the end is fine; a call-to-buy is not.
- **Voice = "the sensible way"** (use this framing verbatim as source): *gluten-free, because it's kind to your body. vegan, because it's kind to animals and the planet. organic ingredients, because every one matters. fiber and protein, to soften the sugar spike. made locally in NYC, because community matters. treats you can feel good about.*
- **Aesthetic:** natural, organic, nature-feeling; clean and refined; healthy lifestyle; a smart, conscious choice. Real ingredients shown honestly.
- **Customer is:** intentional, thoughtful, grounded, clean, natural, balanced, conscious, wholesome. Environmentally conscious, health-minded, prioritizes quality, wants to indulge in a way they can feel good about.
- **Text on creative goes directly on the image** (with a subtle gradient scrim for legibility) — no solid color band behind the copy.

### Sensible type system (distinct from the wassembakes wordmark)

| Role | Font | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Heading / title | **Amaranth** (700) | Web-safe primary (Google Fonts). **Loubag** is the licensed print/Canva alternate — not web-available. |
| Body | **Poppins** (400–600) | Kickers, body, captions. |
| Accent | **Kalam** | Handwritten touch — taglines, small script accents. Use sparingly. |

Titles in Amaranth, one word in the accent color (yellow `#FFD451` on photos, orange `#FF8F1C` on light). This is the Sensible heading system; the Fraunces italic wordmark below is the **wassembakes** brand mark, not Sensible's.

## Brand colors

| Name          | Pantone     | Hex       | Use                              |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Orange        | Pantone 1495 C | `#FF8F1C` | Primary accent, CTAs, energy     |
| Blue          | Pantone 550 C  | `#8DB9CA` | Secondary, calm sections, trust  |
| Yellow        | Pantone 122 C  | `#FFD451` | Highlights, warmth, callouts     |
| Cream         | —           | `#E8DCC8` | Backgrounds, warmth, neutral base |

Don't introduce new brand colors without asking. Neutrals (black, white, grays) are fine for type and UI chrome.

## Logo / wordmark (wassembakes)

The wassembakes wordmark is set in **Fraunces 900 italic** with the `a` in "bakes" and the trailing period in **brand orange (#FF8F1C)**. Type and accents on a yellow (`#FFD451`) field is the canonical brand-mark presentation.

Master files live in `assets/`:

| File                       | Use                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `logo.svg`                 | Stacked wordmark, transparent bg — primary master                   |
| `logo-horizontal.svg`      | Single-line "wassem bakes." — headers, email signatures, wide spaces |
| `logo-square.svg`          | 1:1 with yellow background — IG avatar, app icons, social profiles  |
| `logo-dark.svg`            | Cream/paper type for dark backgrounds — orange accent stays orange  |
| `logo-mark.svg`            | "w." mark only — favicons, tiny placements (≤32px), watermarks      |

Rules:

- **Don't recolor** the type without the orange accent — the colored `a` and period are the recognition cues.
- **Don't compress vertically** or add a stroke. Use the SVG masters; don't recreate in raster unless exporting from these.
- For an OG / Twitter image, export `logo-square.svg` to a 1200×630 PNG with the wordmark left-aligned over yellow. (Raster export not committed yet — use a converter or design tool when needed.)
- In-page text logos (the nav element) use the same accent pattern in HTML: `wassem b<span class="logo-accent">a</span>kes<span class="logo-accent">.</span>` with `.logo-accent { color: var(--orange); }`.

## Voice

- **Casual** — write like a human, not a brochure.
- **Direct** — say the thing. No throat-clearing, no "we are excited to announce."
- **Authoritative** — Wassem has **20+ years** of baking experience. Write from that seat.
- **No corporate marketing speak** — avoid "artisanal," "curated," "journey," "passionate about," "handcrafted with love," "elevate," "unlock," "empower."

Good: "These are the cookies we actually bake every day. Here's what's in them."
Bad: "We're passionate about curating an elevated, handcrafted cookie experience."

When in doubt, read it out loud. If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, rewrite it.

## Tech stack preferences

- **Hosting:** Netlify
- **Source control / deploys:** GitHub (auto-deploy from `main`)
- **Frontend:** plain HTML/CSS/JS. **No build step** unless there's a real reason.
- **No WordPress.** Don't suggest it, don't migrate to it.
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **Product data:** Shopify API (product catalog only — not the storefront)
- **Orders / accounting:** QuickBooks

When making technical recommendations, stay inside this stack. If something requires stepping outside it (e.g., a framework, a CMS, a different payment processor), flag the tradeoff and ask before proposing it as the default.

## Quick checklist before shipping copy or code

- [ ] Tone matches voice guide (casual, direct, authoritative, no marketing speak)
- [ ] Colors are from the palette above
- [ ] Regulatory/compliance claims are stated verbatim, not paraphrased
- [ ] Tech choices fit the stack (Netlify, GitHub, plain HTML, Stripe, Shopify API, QuickBooks)
- [ ] Brand is used correctly: business = Sensible Bakery, creator = wassembakes
